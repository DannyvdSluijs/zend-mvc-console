# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order by release.

## 1.0.0 - 2016-03-23

First stable release.

This component replaces the various console utilities in zend-mvc, zend-router,
and zend-view, and provides integration between each of those components and
zend-console.

While this is a stable release, please wait to use it until a v3 release of
zend-mvc, which will remove those features, to ensure everything works together
as expected.
